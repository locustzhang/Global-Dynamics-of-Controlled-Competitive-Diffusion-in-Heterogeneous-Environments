## Overview

We study a two-species competitive reaction–diffusion system posed on bounded
two-dimensional domains with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
The model incorporates

- spatially heterogeneous intrinsic growth rates, continuous on the closed domain;
- a bounded, time-dependent asymmetric intervention acting on the target species.

The analytical results establish global well-posedness, positive invariance,
and a sharp threshold condition ensuring that the total population density
remains bounded by the carrying capacity.
The numerical simulations provided here illustrate the long-time behaviour of
solutions under admissible interventions and confirm the theoretical findings.

This repository includes all scripts used for analysis, numerical simulation,
and data generation in the paper.

## Mathematical Model

The code implements a two-species reaction–diffusion system of Lotka–Volterra
type with diffusion, spatial heterogeneity, and time-dependent intervention.
The total density is constrained by a carrying-capacity condition, and the
intervention acts asymmetrically on one species.

Precise model equations, assumptions, and theoretical results are described in
the accompanying manuscript.
